# ObjectDetection

The primary goal of this project is to make a device that can detect object and make learning easy.

It’ll recognize the object through camera, then it’ll detect it and give us a required output.

Through IOT we can also use it as a security system.

Language used is python
Interface is created using tkinter.
Algo and libraries  are used for detecting the object
	i)   Tikinter(for interface)
	ii)  Open Cv
	iii) net(a Package of OpenCv  )
  iv) YOLO
  v)  Mobile.net
  vi)  KNN
